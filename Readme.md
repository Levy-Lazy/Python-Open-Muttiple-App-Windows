# Open Multiple Applications Script

This script is used to open multiple applications at once. The script uses the `subprocess` module to open each application by calling the command `Popen(app)`, where `app` is the name of the application to open.

## Usage

- Replace the applications in the list with the names of the specific applications you want to open on your system.
- Make sure you have python installed on your system.
- Run the script by using command `python scriptname.py`

## Requirements
- Python 3

## Note
- The script is written for Windows, and the name of the applications may be different on other operating systems.
- You can add more applications as you want, by adding the name of the application in the list.

## Note by me
- This Script write by AI...
